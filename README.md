# TrinityCreator2
Trinity Creator 2 is a tool to help WoW private server developers with the creation of custom content.  
It supports various emulators, can be extended to work for other emulators and is backwards compatible with the original [Trinity Creator](https://github.com/NotCoffee418/TrinityCreator).
**THIS TOOL IS STILL IN DEVELOPMENT!** Please use [Trinity Creator 1](https://github.com/NotCoffee418/TrinityCreator) for now!

### What?
You can expect the following improvements over the original version:
- Improved user interface
- Backwards compatibility with TC1
- Fewer bugs and crashes
- Improved updating

### Why?
I used the original TrinityCreator as a playground to learn new programming concepts.  
Now I'd like to do the same with Trinity Creator 2 for more advanced concepts.

### When?
I have several projects I'm working on, so it very much depends on when I want to try out new concepts and if people are interested in this new version.

### Where?
Trinity Creator 2 will be a [PWA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressive_web_application), meaning it runs in the browser but can also be installed on your computer.
You can view the current state of the application at [trinitycreator2.pages.dev](https://trinitycreator2.pages.dev). I wouldn't try to use it just yet though!
